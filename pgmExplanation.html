    <h2>Preparing to Upload Your YouTube Video</h2>
    Knowing how to upload a <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a></b> video is invaluable in reaching new contacts and growing your audience. In fact, a survey by Wyzowl found that <b>86%</b> of businesses use video as a marketing tool and <b>92%</b> of marketers value video as an important part of their marketing strategy.</p>
    <p>Learning how to prepare to upload your YouTube video will save you time when uploading. This is the first step in learning YouTube advertising for beginners. Here is how to prepare:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sign in to your YouTube account.</li>
      <li>Click the camera icon with a plus sign in the top right corner of the screen.</li>
      <li>Select <b>"Upload video"</b> from the dropdown menu.</li>
      <li>Choose the video file you want to upload from your computer.</li>
      <li>Fill in the video details, such as title, description, and tags. Try and make them appealing to both a viewer and the site's <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr>.</li>
      <li>Select your video's privacy settings (public, unlisted, or private).</li>
      <li>Click <b>Publish</b> to complete the upload process.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By following these steps, you can easily upload your video to YouTube and share it with your audience!</p>

    <h2>Consistency Is Key</h2>
    <p>Consistency is key when it comes to YouTube success. Just like going to the gym, uploading videos regularly helps build your channel and keeps your audience engaged. Remember, one video won't make a huge difference, but consistently showing up and improving will lead to growth over time.</p>
    <p>To maximize your YouTube success, consider creating a content calendar to plan your uploads and stay on track. This can help you maintain consistency and ensure that you're providing valuable content to your audience on a regular basis.</p>
    <i><q>YouTube is like the gym, talk about consistency. One session won’t change your body — treat your videos like reps. The more you show up, the stronger your channel gets. Some days you’re tired, some days you’re motivated, but consistency always wins. Keep posting. Keep improving. The results come later.</q></i>

    <h2>Monetization</h2>
    <p>Once you have a consistent upload schedule and a growing audience, you can start thinking about monetizing your YouTube channel. To be eligible for monetization, you need to meet certain requirements, such as having at least <b>1,000 subscribers</b> and <b>4,000 watch hours</b> in the past <mark>12 months</mark>. Once you meet these requirements, you can apply for the YouTube Partner Program, which allows you to earn money from ads displayed on your videos, channel memberships, and Super Chat.</p>
    <p>The typical rule of thumb is that you can earn around $1 to $3 per 1,000 views, but this can vary widely based on factors such as your niche, audience demographics, and the type of ads being displayed. To maximize your earnings, creating videos longer than 8 minutes allows you to place ads in the middle of the video, rather than at the beginning or end.</p>

    <h2>Editing Your Videos</h2>
    <p>Editing your videos is an important step in creating high-quality content that engages your audience. There are many video editing software options available, ranging from free to paid, that can help you enhance your videos with effects, transitions, and music. Some popular video editing software includes Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, and iMovie. When editing your videos, consider adding captions, annotations, and calls to action to encourage viewers to subscribe, like, and share your content.</p>

    <h3>Example Program</h3>
    <p>The following program checks whether the time between cuts in a video is ideal for maintaining viewer attention while editing. The values are rough estimates and may vary based on the specific video and audience.</p>
    <pre><code>
      let cutLength = 4; // Seconds between cuts
      let idealCut = 6; // Ideal seconds between cuts

      if (cutLength &lt; idealCut) {
        console.log("The cuts are too fast, consider slowing down.");
      }
      if (cutLength &gt; idealCut) {
        console.log("The cuts are too slow, consider speeding up.");
      }
      if (cutLength === idealCut) {
        console.log("The cuts are at an ideal speed for maintaining viewer attention.");
      }
    </code></pre>

    <p>In this program, the variable <u><code>cutLength</code></u> represents the time between cuts in seconds, and <u><code>idealCut</code></u> represents the ideal time between cuts.</p>
    <p>The program uses conditional statements to compare the two values and provides feedback on whether the cuts are too fast, too slow, or ideal for maintaining viewer attention.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>For example, when <code>cutLength</code> is set to 4 seconds, the program will output "The cuts are too fast, consider slowing down."</li>
    <li>If <code>cutLength</code> is set to 8 seconds, the program will output "The cuts are too slow, consider speeding up."</li>
    <li>If <code>cutLength</code> is set to 6 seconds, the program will output "The cuts are at an ideal speed for maintaining viewer attention."</li>
    </ul>
